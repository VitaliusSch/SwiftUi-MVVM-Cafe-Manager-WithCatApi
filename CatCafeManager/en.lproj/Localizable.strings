  How to add a new localization:
     Let's create a Localizable.strings file in the root folder.
     File ▸ New ▸ File, search for .strings extension and name it 'Localizable'.
     After clicking on a new Localizable.strings file you should see 'Localize...' button on the right side.
     Press 'Localize...' and your base localization will be created! In this case English.
